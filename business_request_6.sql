--  12/08/2024  => Initial script creation.
--              => Monthly Repeat Passenger Rate Calculation:
--                  - Added a derived column `monthly_repeat_passenger_rate` to calculate the repeat passenger rate for each city and month.
--                  - Formula: `SUM(fps.repeat_passengers) / SUM(fps.total_passengers) * 100` rounded to 2 decimal places.
--              => City-Wide Repeat Passenger Rate Calculation:
--                  - Added a derived column `city_repeat_passenger_rate` to calculate the overall repeat passenger rate for each city across all months.
--                  - Used `SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY dc.city_name)` to calculate the total repeat and total passengers across all months within each city.
--                  - Formula: `SUM(SUM(fps.repeat_passengers)) OVER (PARTITION BY city_name) / SUM(SUM(fps.total_passengers)) OVER (PARTITION BY city_name) * 100` rounded to 2 decimal places.
--              => Chronological Month Ordering:
--                  - Used `dd.start_of_month` in the `ORDER BY` clause to ensure months are sorted in chronological order.
--              => City and Month-Level Grouping:
--                  - Grouped results by `dc.city_name`, `dd.month_name`, and `dd.start_of_month` for detailed city and month-level analysis.
--              => Enhanced Readability:
--                  - Ordered the final results first by `city_name` (alphabetically) and then by `dd.start_of_month` (chronologically).
