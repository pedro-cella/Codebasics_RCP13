-- Changes
--  12/07/2024  => Initial script creation.
--              => Top 3 Cities Selection: Used a subquery to rank cities based on the total number of new passengers (`SUM(fps.new_passengers)`).
--                  - Ordered the results by `total_new_passengers` in descending order.
--                  - Limited the result to the top 3 cities using `LIMIT 3`.
--              => Bottom 3 Cities Selection: Used a similar subquery to rank cities in ascending order of `total_new_passengers` to identify the bottom 3 cities.
--                  - Ordered the results by `total_new_passengers` in ascending order.
--                  - Limited the result to the bottom 3 cities using `LIMIT 3`.
--              => City Category Labeling: Added a column alias `city_category` to differentiate between "Top 3" and "Bottom 3" city categories in the final result.
--              => UNION ALL: Combined the results from the top 3 cities and bottom 3 cities into a single output for comparison.
