-- Changes
--  12/05/2021  => Initial script creation
--              => Added columns `city_name` and `total_trips` to the query
--               by joining with the `dim_city` table and using aggregate functions.
--  12/06/2021  => Added the avg_fare_per_km to the query, by using a division
--                 operation
--              => Added a new metric: `avg_fare_per_trip` to calculate the average fare per trip in each city.
--               This is calculated by dividing the total fare amount by the number of unique trips. 
--              => Added the `trip_percentage` metric to calculate the percentage of trips in each city compared to the total number of trips.
--               This is calculated by dividing the number of trips in each city by the total number of trips and multiplying by 100 
--              => Sorted the results by `trip_percentage` in descending order.
