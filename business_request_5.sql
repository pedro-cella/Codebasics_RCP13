-- Changes
--  12/07/2024  => Initial script creation.
--              => Highest Revenue Month Identification:
--                  - Used `RANK()` to rank months by revenue within each city (`PARTITION BY city_name ORDER BY SUM(fare_amount) DESC`).
--                  - Filtered for the highest revenue month per city (`highest_revenue_month = 1`).
--              => Revenue Calculation:
--                  - Calculated monthly revenue for each city and month using `SUM(fare_amount)` as `revenue`.
--                  - Calculated the total city revenue across all months using `SUM(SUM(fare_amount)) OVER (PARTITION BY city_name)` as `total_city_revenue`.
--              => Percentage Contribution Calculation:
--                  - Added a derived column `percentage_contribution` to calculate the proportion of the highest revenue month to the total city revenue.
--                  - Formula: `(revenue / total_city_revenue) * 100` rounded to 2 decimal places.
--              => City-Level Grouping:
--                  - Grouped results by `city_name` and `month_name` to enable city-level analysis.
--              => Ordering by City Name:
--                  - Ordered the final results alphabetically by `city_name` for easier readability.
